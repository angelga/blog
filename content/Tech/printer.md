I had always disliked home printers. Mainly because cartriges were expensive, and because printers themselves had very low quality and few features. However, we had been looking for a good scanner, as we like to keep digital copies of impartant documents. I came across a deal on this laser printer/scanner, and looking at the specs and reviews, it looked like a good buy. I also liked that it only prints in b&w. I didn't plan on printing much, but I did like having the option to do so.

A couple of months later, and I love this printer. I do print more often than I anticipated, but yet the sample toner is still 80% full. And I really like that it can print double sided.

The best feature, however, is the scanner. Since brother privides an iOS app for using the printer (iPrint&Scan), I can scan directly to my phone and share however I want with friends and family.

The printer connects to your home network via WiFi. It did give me a lot of headaches when my mac/phone couldn't connect to the printer. I was so frustrated, but a friend of mine has the same printer and he fixed with this simple setting:

- From your printer's home screen, tap on Settings
- Tap on network -> WLAN-> TCP
- Scroll all the way down to IPv6 and tap
- Turn on IPv6

That's it. After turning on IPv6, my mac and iphone never fail to connect. Happy scanning!
